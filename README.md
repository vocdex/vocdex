### Hi, I'm Shukrullo 👋


I'm a mechanical engineer turned software engineer. 

- ✍️ I write about my ML journey on my [Blog](https://vocdex.github.io/blog/)
- 📚 I'm currently taking classes at Acalonia school in Tokyo, Japan. I am passionate about Computer Vision and NLP research and applications.
- 😅 Fun fact: Since I came to Japan, I have worked part-time as a waiter, language teacher,kitchen staff, moving service staff, hotel cleaning staff. I got to travel to many cities (free) and interact with people from different walks of life.

I'm best reached via [twitter](https://twitter.com/seanphilio). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration(Kaggle, Projects, Papers).
