### Hi, I'm Shukrullo 👋


- 🎓 I am passionate about Computer Vision,Robotics, NLP.
- 📚 I'm currently reading [Probabilistic Robotics](https://docs.ufpr.br/~danielsantos/ProbabilisticRobotics.pdf) and [Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2022/ml-pytorch-book.html)
- 😅 Sometimes, I turn into a hardcore perfectionist, I set unrealistic goals and SUFFER. 


I'm best reached via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shukrullo-nazirjonov/). I'm always open(maybe not at the moment) to interesting conversations and collaboration(Kaggle, Projects, Papers).
